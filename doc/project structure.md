### Explanation of Key Folders:

1. **core/**: Contains essential elements like constants, themes, and reusable widgets that are used across the app.

2. **data/**: Manages all data-related functionalities such as models, repositories, and services (like networking or local storage). For instance, models for user accounts, SSH connections, and other entities reside here.

3. **domain/**: Focuses on the business logic layer, separating concerns and following clean architecture principles. This ensures scalability for future features.

4. **presentation/**: Deals with the UI aspect of your app, including the various screens and reusable UI components specific to each feature.

5. **providers/**: Handles the state management system, ensuring that the app’s state is efficiently managed (whether you use Riverpod, Provider, or another state management tool).

6. **routes/**: Manages the navigation logic, defining how the app moves between different screens.

7. **l10n/**: Adds support for multiple languages, keeping the app open for future internationalization.

8. **config/**: Stores configuration settings for different environments (development, production, etc.).

This structure will ensure that your app remains maintainable and scalable as the project grows with additional features.
